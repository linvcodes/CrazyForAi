# CrazyForAi — Site

This repository now contains a polished static site scaffold built with Vite. The site is responsive, uses modern fonts, and builds to `docs/` for GitHub Pages.

Quick commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # start dev server with hot reload
npm run build  # build static site into docs/
```

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
- Build the site (`npm run build`) which outputs into `docs/`.
- Commit and push the `docs/` folder to your repository on GitHub.
- In the repository Settings → Pages, select the `main` branch and `/docs` folder as the source.

Files of interest:
- `index.html` — Home / single-page site
- `src/styles.css` — Styling and layout
- `src/main.js` — Small UI helpers
- `vite.config.js` — Build output configured to `docs/`

If you want, I can:
- Add diagrams/mermaid support and a richer authoring layout.
