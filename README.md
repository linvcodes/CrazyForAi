# Why ChatGPT Agent + GitHub?

Agentic capabilities: ChatGPT’s agent uses a suite of tools (a visual browser, a text‑based browser, a terminal and API connectors) to carry out complex tasks.

GitHub integration: The agent can leverage connectors such as GitHub. By linking your GitHub account, the agent can read and write files in your repositories and use them in its responses. This makes it possible to build and refine software projects through conversation.

Natural‑language workflow: You instruct the agent in plain language. It asks clarifying questions when needed and asks for confirmation before taking consequential actions.
